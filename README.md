# sfml-nuget
Create NuGet's package for SFML.

# How to
1 - Start sfml-nuget.ps1

2 - Wait...

3 - Done

Optional :

You can remove the "delete.me" file from the sfml-system-<version>.nupkg archive (located at \build\native\include\)

You can also modify some variables to generate only wanted modules, platforms, etc... (You should know what you are doing, I won't answer any question when packages are customs).
